Planetario is an algorithm that simulates a planetary system with gravity, where the user can control the speed and start/stop the simulation. The algorithm uses a Windows Form with four buttons, each representing a planet with a different mass and color: blue, red, green, and yellow. The algorithm also uses a timer to update the position and velocity of the planets, and a physics engine to calculate the gravitational force between them. The algorithm also displays the speed factor and a start/stop button on the form.

The algorithm is written in C#, an object-oriented and cross-platform programming language. To run the algorithm, you need to have the .NET Framework or the .NET Core installed on your system. Moreover, you need to have an IDE or a text editor that supports the C# language, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop.

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository of the project.
- Open the file Form1.cs with your IDE or text editor.
- Compile and run the code.
- The algorithm will show a Windows Form with four buttons, a label for the speed factor, and a start/stop button.
- Click the start/stop button to begin or pause the simulation.
- The algorithm will show the motion of the planets according to the gravitational force between them.
- Click the speed button to change the speed factor of the simulation. The speed factor can be 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, or 2x.
- You can restart the simulation by clicking the start/stop button again.

The algorithm is distributed under the MIT license, which allows the use, modification and distribution of the code to anyone, as long as the same license is maintained and the authorship of the original author is recognized. The algorithm is based on the concept of planetary motion, which is a branch of physics that studies the movement of celestial bodies under the influence of gravity.
